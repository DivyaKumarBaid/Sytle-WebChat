## Pre-Text:

I did host this on 000webhost which is lags a bit. This basically uses php and Mysql to store the chat logs.

## Installation of Webserver and database to run php File

To run php you can either download database and webserver of your choice or can simply use [```XAMPP```](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
This would install apache(webserver) and MySQL(database).

After installing XAMPP just open the XAMPP's control panel and start ``apache`` and ``MySQL``

Then open``` https://localhost/index.php```

This on PC is in the location of your XAMPP installation and by default it is in ```C:\xampp\htdocs```

This is the place from where XAMPP would have and run your php file so you need to copy php file and other supporting files and paste it in this Folder

## How to execute this Repo:

1. Create a ```php``` virtual environment as mentioned above.
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/DivyaKumarBaid/Public_chat_room.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory
4. Either use a hosting website for really using it Or if you just want to know its working use XAMPP and run it on your machine before hosting it.
